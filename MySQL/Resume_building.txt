•Goal: Identify topically important and relevant terms 
(phrases) from text documents. The terms should ideally 
give a "summary view" of the document. In other words, 
they should address distinct aspects of the document, and 
should be extracted rather than abstracted.
•Possible datasets: ICSI (160 meeting transcripts), NUS (211 
papers), INSPEC (2000 abstracts), SemEval (144 papers). 
•Possible evaluations: Precision, Recall, and F-score (ideally, 
a precision-recall curve) for different methods.
